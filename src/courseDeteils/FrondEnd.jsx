            Every web or mobile application has two parts: a front-end and a
            back-end. The front-end is what the user sees and interacts with.
            Itâ€™s the app on your phone or the website you visit. So, front-end
            developers are in charge of building beautiful, interactive user
            interfaces. The average salary for a front-end Developer is $102,768
            per year in the United States. Here are the courses I've created to
            help you pursue a career as a professional front-end developer.
            Depending on your knowledge and experience level, you can take all
            the courses in order or just pick the ones that you need.
